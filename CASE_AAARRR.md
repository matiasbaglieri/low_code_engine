Customer Acquisition is getting more expensive and harder during 2022 than in the previous years for most brands! If you're struggling with it, don't forget about the impact that a good Email Marketing Strategy could have in helping to make your brand profitable:

Setup those 3 flows today and improve your chances to succeed!

1. Cart Abandonment Flow
2. Browser Abandonment Flow
3. Post-Purchase Upselling

1. Cart Abandonment
Allows you to remind users If they forgot about finishing a purchase in your shop, also is a perfect moment to add some discount or incentive (such as Free shipping). We've seen excellent results sending 4 emails: 1 hour after, 20 hours after, 48 hours after, and 72 hours after.

2. Browser Abandonment Flow
This is ideal to add some Lead Magnet or incentive to be part of your email lists, such as an extra %OFF, a good perk, or inviting them to a community with benefits, this is ideal to decrease your CPL (Cost per lead) and be able to convert them in your broadcasts.

Also for us, lately is working really well to use the Browser Abandonment Flow to nurture relationships, talking about the brand's USP in a 4-7 emails series that helps us to position our customers' products in their prospect's minds without being pushy.

3. Post-Purchase Upselling.
This is a great way to increase the AOV (Average Order Value) of your sales, to us has been working very well to sell category upgrades with an extra discount, making our AOV/CAC more sustainable, helping us a lot to have better ROAS and make acquisition more sustainable for our customers.

Remember, that email brings you:
-Tons of chances to upsell, downs, and cross sell
-Easy to market new products/launches
-No cost 💰💰💰
- Delivers best ROI
- Beneficial in the long run


Some ideas to test instead of a standard site-wide discount:

-Buy 2 get 1 FREE
-Spend 50$ to get a secret gift
-Every 3rd customer today gets product X for FREE
-Bundle with 40% OFF
-Buy a bundle and choose a free gift
-Spend 100$ and get 30% OFF
-Spend 100$ and get 30$ OFF

Are like snowflakes ❄️

No two are ever the same. Maybe it’s an:
💻 Intro call
💻 Catch up call
💻 Sales call
💻 Coaching call
💻 Partner call
💻 Vendor call

Meeting links are one of the BEST places for market research. The problem is, there's little value in asking the same questions for each of these 🤔

That’s why I have 5:
- a sales call
- 2 types of client calls (new/regular)
- 2 kinds of networking calls (intro/catch-up)

That ensures I ask the right questions based on the person and the type of call we’re scheduling.

💡 Not only does this help prepare me for that particular call…

But when I go back and look at all answers provided across every call I've ever had, broken out by meeting type... 🤯

That’s some serious data!!


How many meeting links do you have?

You have an awesome idea for a new NFT marketplace, but you don't know where to start. You've got to build the entire thing from scratch, and it's going to take a lot of time and effort.

And even then—who knows if it'll ever be ready?

What if instead of spending all that time and money on developing your own NFT marketplace, you could have a custom branded, market-ready NFT marketplace up and running on your domain in less than a week?

Would that be worth it?
